Tomas Lycken After a good nights sleep, you wake up in your own bed, trying to remember how you got there.

This is how you should have played (and a fairly accurate account of what really happened...):

> use router
The router is now on
> use computer
The computer is now on
> use computer with router
You are now connected to the Internet. A world of possibilities, kittens and rule 34 lies at your feet. (at least if your feet are at the ends of your fingertips...)
> use computer with www.facebook.com
The computer shows you the news feed of your facebook page.
> use www.facebook.com to cry for help
Your mother answers the call. After some discussion about possibilities, she acts as a communication relay and calls all your co-workers, but no one answers.
> use computer with eniro.se
What do you want to search for?
> search for emmie's private number
You now have emmie's private number
> give emmie's private number to mom
Mom calls emmie's private number. She answers. After a while, she promises too come to work and let you out. However, since she lives on the other side of town, it Will take her an hour to get there.
> kill time with www.facebook.com
It's super effective!
Your mother contacts you again. Emmie is in the parking lot outside, but she has no keys to the building.
> open window
The window is now open
> use work keys with window
You throw the keys to the office out the window. It takes them approximately three seconds to reach the ground. Emmie picks them up, and walks into the building. After a couple of minutes, you hear a distinctive clicking sound as the door is unlocked, and emmie's voice calls your name.
You are very hungry, but now you can go home.
Thanks for playing!
